1- Correction, we have 48 states + D.C
2- Available IR = 32 states, missing IR = 17 states
   Available PR = 41 states, missing PR = 8 states
3- I round to incident cases and AC to the nearest hundered, then I estimate the AF = AC/Incident cases. States with a relatively low number of AC and incident case are severly affected by rounding them to the nearest hunderd, the AF can be severly 
distorted. For example say State X before and after rounding:
(1) Before; Incident cases = 925, AC = 55 >>> AF = 55/925 = 5.95% -- This is before rounding 
(2) After;  Incident cases = 900, AC = 100 >> AF = 100/900 = 11.11% -- This is after rounding
The overall AF of the state should not be affected by adjusting the IR, this can be proven mathamaticaly:

Incident cases = children * IR  << we are only changing this part of the formula with the new IR 

If for example the IR of state (X) reduced by 30%, then the Incident cases with reduce by 30% and the AC will reduce by 30% thus the AF with also reduce by 30%  >>
(new IR = old IR * 0.3
(new Incident cases = old incident cases * 0.3)
(new AC = old AC * 0.3)
(old AF = AC * Incident cases
(new AF=  [AC * 0.3]/[Incident cases * 0.3]) 
or
(new AF = old AF * 0.3

AC = Incident cases * (PAF)

AF = AC/Incident cases
